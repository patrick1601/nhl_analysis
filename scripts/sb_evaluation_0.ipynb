    "## Betting Lines and Expected Value\n",
    "To understand the calibration curve we are about to create we first need to understand some betting principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coin Flipping Odds\n",
    "Lets say a friend offers you a bet. He flips a coin, if it lands on heads you pay him 10 dollars if it lands on tails he will pay you 10 dollars (even odds). Should you take this bet? You will not be surprised to learn that the answer to this is it does not matter. Since there is an even chance of the coin landing on heads or tails and you friend is offering you even odds this is a 0 expected value (EV) bet. You will lose some bets, you will win some bets but over many bets you will come out even.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario 2. Lets say this time your friend says if it lands on heads I will give you 15 dollars and if it lands on tails you only have to give me 10. You are betting 10 to potentially win 15 which would be equivalent to a +150 moneyline bet. Should you take this bet? The obvious answer is yes. Since there is a 50% chance of the coin landing on heads but your friend is offering you better than 50% odds this is a positive EV bet. You will lose some bets you will win some bets but over many bets you will make money.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario 3. This time your friend says if it lands on heads I will give you 10 dollars if it lands on tails you owe me 15. You are betting 15 to potentially win 10 which would be equivalent to a -150 moenyline bet. Should you take this bet? The obvious answer is no. Since there is a 50% chance of the coin landing on heads but your friend is offering you worse than 50% odds this is a negative EV bet. You will lose some bets you will win some bets but over many bets you will lose money\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sports Betting\n",
    "So how does this apply to sports betting? Sports betting is betting on a coin flip however the coin is not evenly weighted. Your job as a bettor is to determine the true odds and which side is the positive EV bet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine the Flames are playing the Oilers tonight. The sportsbook is offering the Flames at -200 and the Oilers at +190 which side do you bet? The process to determine this is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Convert the money line odds to percentages\n",
    "    -200 odds is equivalent to the sportsbook saying they think the Flames have a 66% chance of winning\n",
    "    +190 odds is equivalent to the sportsbook saying they think the Oilers have a 33% chance of winning\n",
    "2. Run your own analysis to determine what percent chance you think each team has of winning. Typically you would use some sort of model to determine this. We are going to build a machine learning model that will calculate these percentages for us. Lets say you run your model and come up with the following\n",
    "    Flames will win 60% of the time\n",
    "    Oilers will win 40% of the time\n",
    "3. Now which side do you bet? \n",
    "    - Based on the odds the sportsbook thinks the Flames win 66% you think they win only 60% therefore betting the Flames would be negative EV.\n",
    "    - Also based on the odds the sportsbook thinks the Oilers will win 33% of the time however you think they will actually win 40% of the time therefore betting the Oilers is positive EV.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the Flames are more likely to win the game betting them is negative EV and you would lose money over time. Betting the Oilers is a positive EV bet even though you will lose this bet more often than not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way sportsbooks make money is that they try to set the betting line so both sides of the bet are negative EV. This is due to a comission they bake into the line. If Sportsbook determines that a teams true odds are -200 they will actually offer the bet at say -220 this way they can make both sides of the bet negative EV ensuring they always make a profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of any sports betting model is to identify bets where the sportsbook odds do not reflect a teams true odds of winning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Calibration Curve\n",
    "Now that we have some betting theory out of the way lets start creating a calibration curve. This first function will take our game database list and calculate the sportsbooks accuracy in predicting games. If the predicted favourite actually ends up winning the game then that is counted as a correct prediction. If the underdog wins that is an incorrect prediction."
